G'day mate! ðŸ¤ 

This is the github for [lectorials.dev](https://lectorials.dev). [lectorials.dev](https://lectorials.dev) is an environment for learning the *why* and how of computer science. 

Over time the vision is [lectorials.dev](https://lectorials.dev) will be a one stop stop to learn the ins and outs of computer science without the need to sort through hundreds of videos and online resources. Initially we won't have many, but give it time my friend. It will build, and with patience we should have a great resource for you and your friends. 

The best way to navigate all the repositories associated with this github is to go to [lectorials.dev](https://lectorials.dev). This is because they're organised by topic and difficulty. You will also find all the relevant lectorial instructions and information for the particular repository you're interested in.

If you learn the *why* then the how of development, imagine how much better a developer you will be!
